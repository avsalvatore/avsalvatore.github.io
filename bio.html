	<p>
		I am a computer science student at Tufts University in Boston, MA. I'm originally from California and I miss the west coast every day. I grew up doing activities that didn't require a lot of athleticism like golf and sewing. Needless to say, I killed it in the retirement age group. These days you can find me studying or tweeting jokes about food.
